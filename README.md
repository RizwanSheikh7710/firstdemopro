## Practically Exploring Formating Elements Of Readme.md
**How you can add code into your repo ?**
A simple html app to demonstrate performance costs of data structures.
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the root of the project in a termina or command prompt
- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start'
- Go to the URL specified in the terminal or command prompt to try out the app.
# This app was created from the Create React App NPM. Below are instructions from that project.
Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

### Table of Contents
- Updating to New Releases
- Sending Feedback
- Folder Structure
- Available Script
  - npm start
    - npm run build
      - npm run eject
### Updating to New Releases
- `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
- `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
## Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:
``` my-app/
  README.md
  index.html
  favicon.ico
  node_modules/
  package.json
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
``` 
You may create subdirectories inside `src.` For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside** `src`, ***or Webpack wonâ€™t see them.***
### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
`**npm start**`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.

### **`Button.css`**
```
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```
##Adding Flow
Flow typing is currently [Basic writing and formatting syntax
For Readme.md file](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#section-links) with the default .flowconfig generated by Flow. If you run it, you might get errors like this:
```
node_modules/fbjs/lib/Deferred.js.flow:60
 60:     Promise.prototype.done.apply(this._promise, arguments);
                           ^^^^ property `done`. Property not found in

            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./index.css. Required module not found
```
            
```
            render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>
      <form>
        <input type="hidden" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Surge
Install the Surge CLI if you haven't already by running `npm install -g surge.` Run the surge command and log in you or create a new account. You just need to specify the build folder and your custom domain, and you are done.
  ```
  email: email@domain.com
           password: ********
       project path: /path/to/project/build
               size: 7 files, 1.8 MB
             domain: create-react-app.surge.sh
             upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s
   propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%
               plan: Free
              users: email@domain.com
         IP Address: X.X.X.X

    Success! Project is published and running at create-react-app.surge.sh
```
